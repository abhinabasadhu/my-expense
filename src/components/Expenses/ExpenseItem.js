// the props from the app.js is accessed here.
// each item with the array numbering is setup with each property of date , amount and title
// We split the date component so that we can keep the code lean
// We call prosp in the function in the ExpenseDate
// So we call that function here And use the ExpenseDate component and set the date as prop.date
// useState is a react hook helps to change the state of a item
// useState should be called directly on the function not in the nested fuction and not aboce the or below the function
// we will not assign values with = sign but we will assign values by calling useState
// first value is the value itself and the second value is the value to set to be updates
// title is =  to props.title
// setTitle is a function which we can later call to set a new title we call it anything the convention is imp
// always returns a array of 2 elements
